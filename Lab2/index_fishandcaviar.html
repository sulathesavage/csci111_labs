<h1> Fish diversity</h1>
<p> Although Atyrau is well-known for The Black Gold, there is also one more thing that Atyrau citizens can be proud of. Thanks to Ural River and some parts of Caspian Sea, there are a huge number of different fishes.</p>
<p> The river is navigated up to Uralsk and there is a port in Atyrau. Fishery is well developed; the commercial fish species include sturgeon, perch, herring, bream, carp and catfish. The delta of Ural River accounts for about half of the fish catchment in Kazakhstan </p>
